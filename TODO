A kind of roadmap / todo list.

[0.3]
 * Proper ramdisk (tmpfs) support
 * Add isohybrid support [done]
 * Add a way to import keys for archives
 * Check if the archives are reachable before starting build
   (no point if network is down)
 * Check if there's enough disk space on the right paths before starting
 * Rework Manifests so that it properly calculates packages to be removed
 * Store disk uuid in .disk/casper-uuid-generic

[0.4]
 * Be able to specify packages that must be shipped on CD pool
 * Preconfigure for configuration management systems (bcfg2, puppet, cfengine,
   etc) generic item [TODO]
 * Implement an easy way to support configuration preseeds, most notable for
   stuff like grub, java plugins, etc

[future]
 * Possible Fedora support using yum + febootstrap
 * Make debmower more resiliant to when things go wrong (stale proc, etc). Perhaps sandboxing?
 * Support hooks for custom scripts
 * Add target for KVM
 * Add target for LXC
 * Add target for USB disk

[error-checking-wishlist]
 * Check if PPA sources fail, eg: "W: failed to fetch"...
