A kind of roadmap / todo list.

[0.3]
 * Proper ramdisk (tmpfs) support
 * [done] Add isohybrid support
 * [done] fail if apt-get update doesn't succeed
 * Check if there's enough disk space on the right paths before starting
 * Rework Manifests so that it properly calculates packages to be removed
 * [done] Store disk uuid in .disk/casper-uuid-generic
 * [done] Store release_notes_url if configured

[0.4]
 * Add a way to import keys for archives
 * Be able to specify packages that must be shipped on CD pool
 * Preconfigure for configuration management systems (bcfg2, puppet, cfengine,
   etc) generic item [TODO]
 * Implement an easy way to support configuration preseeds, most notable for
   stuff like grub, java plugins, etc
 * Reduce needs for templates to minimum
 * html page for autorun.inf config

[future]
 * Possible Fedora support using yum + febootstrap
 * Make debmower more resiliant to when things go wrong (stale proc, etc). Perhaps sandboxing?
